  üö® How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users

Access passwords, credit card numbers, emails, or address book data.

Some extensions log every keystroke or page visited.

Data is often sent to third parties or cybercriminals.

2. Injecting Ads and Redirects
Insert unauthorized ads into websites.

Redirect your search engine to fake or ad-heavy pages.

Generate revenue through affiliate fraud.

üí∏ Effect: Users are flooded with unwanted ads or are tricked into clicking malicious links.

3. Browser Hijacking
Change your homepage or default search engine.

Prevent you from changing browser settings back.

Force-install more malicious extensions.

4. Cryptojacking
Use your device to secretly mine cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) using your CPU power.

Slows down your system and drains battery.

5. Downloading or Installing Malware
Can install ransomware, spyware, or trojans through browser backdoors.

Sometimes bundled with fake updates or downloads.

6. Tracking and Surveillance
Track browsing behavior across sites.

Build profiles for targeted phishing or selling to advertisers/data brokers.

7. Bypassing Security Tools
Disable or interfere with antivirus software.

Block browser security warnings or redirect security-related sites.

üõ°Ô∏è How to Protect Yourself:
Avoid installing extensions with few reviews or unknown developers.
